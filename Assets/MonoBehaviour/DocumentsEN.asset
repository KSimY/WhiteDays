    desc: 'Title: The Mental Health of the Students<br>(The Anxiety of Students and Their Ineffective Coping Methods)<br>Written by: Tae-guen Lim,<br>School Administration Manager and Korean Language Teacher<br><br>Many of our students suffer from considerable anxiety about their future.{split}<br>This is quite natural considering their state as adolescents. However, some students are using odd methods in attempt to cope with their anxiety issues. These odd "coping methods" are spreading across the school like wildfire.<br>In a way, this brings light to the fact that the students today lack responsibility and a sense of identity.<br>The real problem, however, is that some of these odd coping methods are taken as more than just a joke; they are turning into a fanatic religion.{split} Students who have yet to form a solid sense of identity are more easily lured into joining these "fanatic sects."<br>One of the main coping methods the students are using is the act of "Calling the Dead."<br>Using an Ouija Board, students attempt to call upon the dead to quell the uncertainties they face by asking the ghost questions or even to predict the future. At a glance, it could be dismissed as an immature act of self-reassurance that can be safely ignored. However, that is not the case.<br>When such acts are committed repeatedly, the student will often eventually lose his or her grasp on reality and, in some extreme cases, the student exhibits a full-on psychological breakdown. <br>This matter must be resolved for the safety of the school, and heavy supervision is advised until a permanent solution is in effect.'

On average, consuming no more than 400mg is recommended to enjoy the health benefits. A cup of coffee contains approximately 100mg of caffeine.{split}Regular consumption of caffeinated products such as coffee can lead to caffeine addiction and eventually cause withdrawal symptoms.<br>Common withdrawal symptoms include, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and headache.<br><br>However, the harmful properties of caffeine itself are not worrisome. It is when caffeine is consumed in excess that it becomes a health hazard. Overconsumption of caffeine leads to the onset of harmful symptoms, and continuous consumption can lead to death.{split}For adults, the lethal dosage of caffeine is 150mg/kg, or about 50-200 cups of coffee. The lethal dose is much lower for children and teenagers.<br>Caffeine is also known to cause birth defects.<br>Like alcohol and nicotine, caffeine is a drug with addictive properties, but unlike the others it does not have any age restrictions.<br>Therefore, it is important to better understand the properties of caffeine and moderate its consumption.

    desc: Vibration and Resonance<br>Objects change when energy is applied, and when that energy is gone the objects return to their original state. This property of returning to the original state is called Elasticity. When the energy that was being applied to an elastic object is gone, the object vibrates at the equilibrium point.<br>Each object has its own frequency. This frequency is called the natural{split}frequency.<br>Forced vibration is when an object is forced to vibrate at the same frequency of the energy that's being applied to it.<br>When the forced vibration and natural vibration are the same, the amplitude increases and this is what's known as resonance.<br>Amplitude increasing from resonance means that the energy is being efficiently transferred.<br>This is the result of energy being equal to resonance squared.{split}Examples of energy amplification by resonance can be found in many places.<br><br>For example, in 1940, the Tacoma Bridge of Washington State in the U.S. collapsed due to a small gust of wind only after 4 months of being completed.<br>This happened because the wind resonated with the natural frequency of the bridge, increasing the amplitude.<br>Another example is when a singer's voice is able to shatter a glass by reaching a certain pitch. This is{split}possible because the frequency of the singer's voice resonated with the natural frequencies of the glass cup.<br><br>(Just imagine using your voice to shatter glass or mirrors!)

    desc: About Labyrinths<br>During the times of ancient Greece, the word labyrinth referred to an underground building that was designed to be a maze. Labyrinths are later seen as high-fenced gardens during the Renaissance age.<br><br>The four great labyrinths of the world are the Egyptian Labyrinth, the Cretan Labyrinth, the Lemnos Labyrinth, and the Italian Labyrinth.{split}There are two kinds of labyrinths.<br>The first kind is designed so that all paths lead to the center. In this type of labyrinth, the same path will not be taken twice, but one must take longest distance possible to reach the destination.<br>In the second kind, the paths are forked and very complicated, making it very easy to get lost. To deal with this type of labyrinth, one must rely on memory and good judgement.<br><br>The labyrinth symbolizes many different meanings and its symbol and appearance changes depending{split}on the era and region.<br>A traditional meaning of the labyrinth signifies exclusion and imprisonment; allowing only those who are worthy to find the exit.<br><br>Getting to the center of the labyrinth symbolizes uterine regression and the labyrinth represents the body of the Mother Earth.<br>Thus, it is the women who own and control the labyrinth, while men must find the right path to escape.{split}<br>The continuity of the labyrinth signifies immortality and eternity, and in the eastern philosophy, it means to escape the cycle of birth and death and the rules of karma.<br>In the perspective of a funeral rite, the labyrinth symbolizes death and resurrection. Going into the labyrinth means death, and coming out of it means resurrection.<br><br>So in a way, the labyrinth can be thought of as a model underworld.

But in that short period of time, I've experienced something that I will never forget.<br>I've always felt there was something sinister about the school. First, the location of this school is far from ideal. The energies of the Yin and Yang intertwine with the terrain, creating a strong natural energy flow. This on itself would not be an issue. However, mixing the energies of restless teenagers in this location has disrupted the energy flow; twisting it into negative energy.{split}The school was oblivious to this fact and did not understand why so many accidents kept occurring since its opening. Finally, with the aid of a Feng Shui expert, they created tokens to contain the violent energy of this place.<br>There were five tokens, one for each element, and they were placed in the school using the repulsion theory to create a base for a very strong barrier. This barrier suppressed the violent energies, and soon, the school was stabilized.<br>But this didn't last for long...<br>While investigating the supernatural{split}phenomena that frequently came up in school, I realized it was all related to the strong energy that was concentrated here.<br>It was the barrier that was the root of it all. The tokens composing the barrier were made from peach wood. Peach wood is known for its power to ward off evil. However, this caused the ghosts of school to be locked inside the barrier along with the disturbed energy, sucking the life force of the living.<br>The school became a place where the world of the living and the world of the dead overlapped.{split}I could hardly believe it, even with my own eyes.<br>An interesting idea occurred to me when I realized this secret. By using the twisted nature of this place and the power trapped within the barrier, I thought it would be possible to transfer a soul of the dead into the body of a living person.<br>I was mesmerized by this sudden yet whimsical theory.<br>Each day I pondered on how to prove this, and as the days went by, my desire to test it grew even greater. When I was near to bursting with frustration, she came to me...{split}Here is the way to perform the ritual.<br><br>Before you start the ritual, make sure the ghost's soul is whole. Only a ghost with its soul intact can be resurrected.<br>What you need to do first is to find the tokens and disable them.<br>This process has to follow the order of five elements' repulsion qualities, and it must take place during a night of a full moon.<br>You would also need a suitable body to be used for receiving the soul.<br>There was a body that the ghost insisted on. But...{split}As time passed I became more afraid.<br>It wasn't that I doubted my theory, I was afraid because I knew it would work. I knew a horrible disaster would occur if something went wrong with the ritual. The barrier would break and unleash the great power that was trapped within.<br>Should something like that happen, remove the tokens in the order of five element's harmonic qualities, place them together in the same spot, and combine the power of Yin and Yang with them.<br><br>A barrier with the power of Yin, {split}Yang and all five elements should be able to shut down the spirits, at least for a while...<br>That will be the only hope then...

They had stopped on their way home to chat with her, even though she was still busy cleaning. They didn't even offer to help and just left her on her own when they ran out of things to talk about. This{split}made Mi-hyeon uneasy as Y High School was full of scary rumors.<br>To make matters worse, she saw no students around today. She found the echoing of her own footsteps quite nerve-wracking.<br>Her anxiety grew even more when she saw the potted tree in the corner of the hallway.<br>This plant used to belong to her homeroom teacher last year. It reminded her of him and what happened that year.<br>Her homeroom teacher, Mr. B, taught Chinese. He was quiet and had a thin build. He gave off a sad {split}vibe. He wasn't friendly at all. Not even trying to connect with his students or fellow teachers. He did, however, seem interested in maintaining his plants. He took extra care in the plant of his homeroom, Junior Homeroom 2. He cared for his plant so much that he checked on it during every class break.<br>Then one day, a student accidentally dumped chemical solvent on Mr. B's favorite tree. The tree turned black and shriveled up completely.<br>Afraid of the repercussions, the student replaced the tree and decided to burn the old one. {split}Even his friends were in on his plan. Together they moved the dead plant to the incinerator and lit it on fire. The dead tree easily caught fire and was soon burning with billowing black smoke. When the flames grew more intense, a scream was heard. It was like the burning tree was screaming out in pain.<br>That's when Mr. B came running. Watching his favorite tree burning made him go crazy. Before anyone could reason with him, he dashed into the open flames, to be with his favorite tree in the fire. Both Mr. B and the tree were engulfed in flames {split}in a matter of seconds. No one spoke; everyone was in shock from what they had just observed.<br>Judging from the matching statements from the students involved, the police decided that it was a case of suicide by delusion.<br>Mi-hyeon was there that day at the incinerator. That's why every time she saw a plant Mr. B used to care for it made her shiver. She normally made an effort to not pass through where the plants were. She would have walked around it today, too, if she wasn't in such a hurry.<br>Mi-hyeon tried hard to calm herself{split}down when she saw a light on in a nearby homeroom.<br>She heard someone moving in there, too.<br>Scared of being left alone in the dark building, she was happy to see there was someone else in school.<br>She quickly opened the classroom's door.<br>But, what she saw was the back of a man in front of a plant.<br>Mi-hyeon froze in terror when she realized what she was seeing.<br>This was her homeroom from last year; Junior Homeroom 2.{split}The man slowly turned around and faced Mi-hyeon. He was holding a dog's corpse with its belly ripped open and his other hand was covered in blood.<br>Behind him, Mi-hyeon could see that blood and organs were covering the leaves and stems.<br>He slowly approached Mi-hyeon and said,<br>"Oh good, I was running out of food for my tree."

In the female dorm, there was a notorious housemother, Miss C, whom everyone was afraid of.<br>Coming from a good family background, she demanded that the students behaved and followed rules{split}at all times. She would give harsh punishments for any violation of the rules, and this caused many students to complain about her.<br>It was a little after the mid-term when a Junior fell out a third floor window and died. She was trying to sneak out of the dorms while evading the housemother's watch to go out and celebrate the end of the midterms.<br>But for some reason, the rumors spread that the girl committed suicide because of Miss C, or even worse, that Miss C had killed that girl herself.{split}Miss C was in a great shock and for a while she stayed silent as if her spirit was broken. The students were happy about this change and secretly kept an eye on Miss C to see if she would return to her old self.<br>Then came the incident that riled up all the students. Miss C was doing her rounds and found a student whose hair was longer than regulation. Miss C took the student to the bathroom and cut the girl's hair. But when that happened, the student and all of her friends surrounded Miss C and protested against her harsh punishment and{split}strict rules.<br>At first it was only a few students who spoke up. Then, one by one, they were joined by other angry voices opposing Miss C, and soon enough every student in the female dorm started protesting against her. Anywhere Miss C looked, an angry glare met her gaze.<br>Finally, Miss C broke under all the pressure and her own pent-up emotions and she ran out of the dorm, screaming like a madwoman. None of the students cared. No one went after her trying to calm her down.{split}In the end, Miss C's body was found on a nearby mountain a few days after she went missing.<br>Since then, people started reporting that they've seen the ghost of Miss C.<br>The rumor spread quickly, and the girls in the dormitory suffered from insomnia and fear.<br>Eventually the dorm had to be shut down.<br><br>Even so, there are still sporadic reports of sightings of Miss C's ghost.

This particular hallway was the passageway between the Main Building and the New Building, and it was rarely used.<br>It was built with an interesting design that puzzled all those who set eyes on it.{split}Its purpose was to be a bridge that connects one building to another, but it was shaped like a tunnel with florescent lighting but not one window.<br>This made it seem creepy even during the daytime.<br>What''s more, getting to the other building wasn''t a straight path but instead twisted and turned. All of that combined made fewer and fewer students use the walkway, and the less that people used it, the more creepy the rumors about it became.<br>One rumor said that while walking down the passageway, which felt like{split}walking into a cave, there were sounds of footsteps either behind you or coming from the front. Either way, you''d never see anyone there. Another rumor said that if you enter this hallway in the middle of the night, you will never get to the other building but instead get lost in a labyrinth of corridors until the break of dawn.<br>The night before the accident took place, Cheol-min told his friends that he didn''t believe in such a bogus story.<br>Being teenagers, they dared Cheol-min to prove himself. {split}So, Cheol-min and his friends came to school in the middle of the night. The test Cheol-min was given seemed simple: He only had to go through the passageway, get to the other building and bring back an object from a classroom.<br>Cheol-min wasted no time beginning this easy venture and quickly opened the door to the passageway. He disappeared into the darkness and the door shut behind him.<br>When Cheol-min was alone, he realized it was scarier than he had imagined.<br>The passageway was without a single{split}window, and all he could see were the small patches of light like islands in a pitch black sea. Cheol-min shivered and began to regret making this bet with his friends.<br>When the sound of his footsteps echoed loudly in the empty hallway, it felt like something from the darkness would come running out at him at any second.<br>Cheol-min gathered together what courage he had left and started walking as fast as he could.<br>That''s when something passed by him and lightly brushed his neck, making a metallic sound. His hair{split}stood on end. He felt like something was right behind him. Was he hearing things? He thought he also heard faint laughter. Cheol-min, clenching his teeth, bravely turned around.<br>Nothing was there except a completely empty hallway and darkness. Cheol-min, who had been scared to death, was a bit relieved.<br>Until right at that moment he heard a whisper:<br>What are you doing here?<br>Terrified, Cheol-min ran as fast as he could, screaming. It didn''t matter how fast or how far he ran. He{split}would never be able to make it to the building on the other side.<br>At last, Cheol-min suffered a panic attack and was knocked into unconsciousness.<br>His friends, after waiting for a long time, all returned home.<br>Everyone was worried for Cheol-min, yet no one suggested going to look for him.<br>So, that''s how Cheol-min was found laying unconscious in the passageway the next day.<br><br>From that day on, the students have called this passageway {split}"the impassable bridge" or the labyrinth.'

She was{split}dating a boy named Myeong-ho, who shared the same homeroom with her during the first two years of school. When they were in their Senior year, they were assigned to different homerooms and Ji-hye began dating Ho-young who was in the same homeroom as her.<br>Myeong-ho could not accept such a sudden break-up after dating Ji-hye for two years. He tried multiple times to go see her and plead his case but Ji-hye completely ignored him. Growing more resentful with each rejection, Myeong-ho began to hate Ji-hye.{split}One day, Myeong-ho decided to go see Ji-hye one last time in her homeroom during lunch break. Ji-hye, just like all the times before, was cold and cruel and ignored his pleas. Enraged, Myeong-ho took out the knife he had brought with him. Of course, he wasn't planning on hurting her. He wanted to mend his wounded ego by watching her tremble, seeing her finally acknowledge him.<br>However Ji-hye knew him all too well; she knew that even though he acted tough, he was just a narrow-minded, scared little boy.{split}Seeing the his desperate attempt with the knife made him so repulsive that she became angry at him. She called him names and taunted that he would never have the guts to actually use the knife. Alas, her taunting worked; Myeong-ho, momentarily blinded by rage, swung his knife and stabbed Ji-hye.<br>Ji-hye fell to the ground, her blood running across the entire floor. Myeong-ho, scared and confused by the scene, went berserk.<br>Due to Myeong-ho slashing his knife crazily around him, no one dared to go near Ji-hye.

Eun-ju would always prattle on and on about him to Young-hee.<br>Strangely, Young-hee's reaction to{split}her close friend's biggest interest in life was rather icy. She would only wish her a curt good luck, then be silent until a new subject arose.<br>One day, Eun-ju heard from another friend that the guy she liked had feelings for Young-hee instead.<br>It turns out that Young-hee and the boy went to the same church. Eun-ju wondered why Young-hee had never mentioned that. It was weird.<br>From that point on, Eun-ju was suspicious of every single thing Young-hee said or did. Soon they grew so far apart that they wouldn't even say hello to each other.{split}Sometime after, Eun-ju found Young-hee and the boy sitting on a bench innocently talking.<br>Envy filled her eyes.<br>That evening Eun-ju called Young-hee up to the school's rooftop. They began to argue, but Young-hee kept on denying Eun-ju's accusations.<br>The arguing got louder and more heated, and out of anger Eun-ju pushed Young-hee off the rooftop. Young-hee fell down head first, and died instantly without a sound.<br>Eun-ju gave a false statement to the police and Young-hee's death was{split}reported as a suicide.<br>After some time passed, Eun-ju was able to go out with her crush.<br>One day, she made plans with her boyfriend to go on a date at school.<br>They thought it would be a great idea to meet up in the middle of the night. That way they could stay out of the heat and it seemed adventurous. Eun-ju arrived at the school first and was waiting in the empty classroom.<br>When her boyfriend didn't show up after the promised time, she began to get scared.<br>Suddenly...{split}Thunk... Thunk... Thunk...<br>She heard something echoing from the hallway. Then she could hear a door opening.<br>"Not here..."<br>It wasn't her boyfriend's voice. It was the raspy voice of a woman that sent shivers down her spine.<br>Thunk...! Thunk...! Thunk...!<br>The noise was getting louder and closer, until it was shaking the ground with every thunk. Eun-ju heard another door open.<br>"Not here either..."<br>Thunk, Thunk, Thunk... Thunk!! Thunk!!{split}The thunking was getting closer to her now. Terrified, Eun-ju dove under the teacher's desk to hide. She was quaking in fear.<br><br>The door to the classroom flew open.<br>Eun-ju peeked at the door through a crack under the desk.<br>There was nothing to be seen.<br>Just when Eun-ju thought something must be wrong, an object fell from the desk and Eun-ju's eyes flew up to see what knocked it down.<br><br>"There you are!!!!!"<br>Eun-ju screamed so loud that her{split}voice echoed throughout the whole school.

    title: 18. The Mystery in the Biology Lab
    desc: There were many strange rumors surrounding the Biology Lab. Most of them feature a walking manikin or a scraping noise across the floor. Also, most of these rumors were based off the history of the school building.<br>The history of the school building goes all the way back to the occupation era. The building was used as a concentration camp for political prisoners. Some parts of the concentration camp were used by the{split}occupying military to conduct horrendous experiments on human subjects.<br>Every single experiment that was conducted there was evil and inhumane; the screams of the subjects filled the air around the clock.<br>Students believed that the location of the Biology Lab used to be one of those human experimentation labs.<br>So every time there was an accident in the Biology Lab, the students always brought up the idea that it had something to do with the curse of the human experiment victims{split}who were killed there, or that the head researcher remained in the form of a ghost. Some even went on to say that the anatomy manikin in the corner of the room was actually a corpse of one of the experiment subjects.<br>However, the most famous rumor of them all was the "Imprisonment Accident."<br>"D" didn't get very good grades, but he was especially interested in science and he worked hard in his studies. The science teacher took pity on him and recommended "D" to be the school's representative for a{split}science contest. "D" saw it as a great opportunity for him and studied even harder. With the teacher's permission, he stayed behind every day after school ended to study more and prepare himself for the contest. The area which he spent the greatest amount of effort on was the human anatomy composition. He studied the anatomy manikin on a daily basis.<br>A few days before the science contest, "D," who was studying alone in the Biology Lab, was so exhausted that he fell asleep.<br>When he woke up it was dark and{split}the lights had been turned off. He tried to turn the light back on but it didn't work. Even the door seemed to be locked from outside.<br>He had no choice but to stay in the dark Biology Lab and spend the night there.<br>He usually never bothered to think about the rumors, but his current situation triggered his memory to replay all of the scary stories he had heard. The more he tried to not think about them, the stronger they came to his mind.<br>"D" was becoming more afraid with each passing second. He was{split}especially afraid of the anatomy manikin in the dark.<br>His heartbeat raced and it was becoming hard for him to breathe.<br>"D" was so scared that he decided to light an alcohol lamp.<br>Just as the flame brought its flickering light to the room, the anatomy manikin suddenly came alive and slowly started to move towards “D”.<br><br>The next morning, "D" was found dead in the Biology Lab.<br>The cause of death was reported as heart attack.{split}What was failed to be explained was that his nails were ripped from their beds, and on the Biology Lab's door, there were scratch marks with trails of blood, and a word scrawled in blood that read, "Anatomy Manikin."

    title: 20. The Missing Children
    desc: Jung-jae was heading home really late after a school club activity. He belonged to the Mystery Research club. They collected and studied all kinds of rumors, myths, and urban legends. The collection was not only from their own school, but from every city around. Lately he was working on sorting through contents for their sporadically published club magazine. At a busy time like this, the club's president was nowhere to be seen. Due to his absence, Jung-jae as vice president had to do everything himself. That was the reason why he was heading home so late.{split}Still preoccupied with his work, he was thinking about the magazine even while he was crossing the bridge. Just then, somebody spoke to him.<br>"Hello dearie, I'd like to ask you something..."<br>It was a kind and warm-looking grandma who approached. Her chignon hairstyle and her bent back reminded Jung-jae of his own grandma out in the countryside.<br>Right before he was going to answer her, he suddenly paused and wondered.<br>"Why was this old lady at school at this late hour?"<br>In that moment he recalled a ghost story that he had investigated a while back.{split}The building of Y High School was erected in the occupation era and was used as a refugee camp during the Korean war. In the refugee camp there were lots of orphans who had lost their parents in the midst of war. Since the situation was so grim, no one really had the luxury of worrying about these kids. Then, some grandma took these orphans under her wing and took care of them. The kids depended on her and got along with her well. The people didn't suspect anything of this grandma.<br>Then one day the grandma and the orphans suddenly disappeared. The refugees thought it was strange, but as if they had previously agreed they kept silent about it. It was a time where such things happened.{split}A short while after that, a woman came to the camp. She was a mother of one of the orphans. The woman went through so much to find the whereabouts of her child, and was finally here to reunite with them. When she heard of the disappearance of her child, she wailed with despair.<br>The refugees, who felt a little guilty about not having done anything about the disappearance of the orphans, were finally moved to action by the woman's heart-wrenching cries.<br>Lead by a former hunter, a few refugees decided to help the woman and search for the missing orphans.<br>They followed the trail of the children up into the mountain.{split}When they got halfway up, they found an old, run-down hut. They were greeted with the rotting stench of corpses inside the hut, and found the hut was full of small white bones, which seemed relatively fresh.<br>It was said that they never found the old grandma.<br><br>Jung-jae couldn't figure out why he had suddenly remembered that ghost story. Feeling spooked, he kept his mouth shut. Maybe it was the old, traditional dress that the grandma was wearing.{split}The old grandma who was pressing on Jung-jae with her questions slowly revealed herself, and her face twisted and turned into the face of a demon's.<br>From her dark and empty eye sockets, red light gleamed. She mumbled as she smacked her lips.<br>"So close. What a pity..."<br><br>The next thing he knew, he was waking up at his desk. He must have fallen asleep while sorting out the materials. Still, it seemed all too real to be just a dream.<br>On the paper in front of him there was a warning from the material he was reading right before he fell asleep:<br>Never answer her questions.
