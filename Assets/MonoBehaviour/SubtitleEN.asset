  - id: D_SY_01_End_03
    text: Let's try searching in here.
  - id: D_SY_01_End_04
    text: Are you just gonna stand there?
  - id: D_SY_01_End_05
    text: Fine, I don't care. Do whatever you want.
  - id: D_SY_01_Core_01
    text: I wonder why Ji-Hyeon came to school at this hour?
  - id: D_SY_01_Core_02
    text: And the same can be said about you, too.
  - id: D_SY_01_Core_03

    text: I'll take the lead, follow me.
  - id: D_SY_03_Blocked_03
    text: We can't go because you're being like this.
  - id: D_SY_03_End_01
    text: This way.
  - id: D_SY_03_End_02
    text: It's this door.
  - id: D_SY_03_End_03

  - id: D_SY_04_Touched_02
    text: If it wasn't for you, I'd have never made it this far.
  - id: D_SY_04_Touched_03
    text: I won't ask you any more. Please leave.
  - id: D_SY_04_Touched_04
    text: Why are you not going?
  - id: D_SY_04_Touched_05
    text: Why are you acting this way?
  - id: D_SY_04_Touched_06

  - id: D_JH_02_Touched_06
    text: There's something behind you!!
  - id: D_JH_02_Core_01
    text: I heard there was a student who killed herself with poison in the upstairs Art Room.
  - id: D_JH_02_Core_02
    text: And it seems the student was pregnant at that time...
  - id: D_JH_02_Core_03
    text: The school tried to say it was just a rumor…
  - id: D_JH_02_Core_04
    text: But I think it's a true story.
  - id: D_JH_02_Core_05
    text: Because sometimes I hear a baby crying around here...
  - id: D_JH_03_Touched_01
    text: Leave me alone!
